# GAME-CO-Analysis
Game Co is a new video game company that needs data to develop new games.
# Objective and Data
The objective of this project is to perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to have a better understanding of Game Coâ€™s new games will perform in the market. The data is taken from historical sales of video games (for games that sold more than 100,000 copies) spanning different platforms, genres, and publishing studios.

# Hypothesis
The Hypothesis is that video game sales behave almost the same across all geographic regions. Game sales across each geographic region have not remained the same over time. North America and Japan are not steady markets, while Europe kept being consistent, uprising steady. Still, neither markets can compare as sales with NA, being the leader overall of total sold product video games. All make the hypothesis from the beginning wrong.

In 2016 Europe lead the market, increasing steadily but constantly. North America was passed by 6%. For Japan, the leading genres are action and Role-Playing, while in North America and Europe Shooter, Sports or Action has the most success.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Since Japan is a steady market in terms of preferences, we should focus mostly on their products and preferences: own games, most liked genres and 3DS platform.
2. Europe has a big potential and it is in constant growth. We should invest more into this market and keep in mind the primary liked genres: shooter, sport, action.
3.North America most liked genres are: shooter, action, sport. We can promote these.
